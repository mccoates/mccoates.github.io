            <p>I'm Matt Coates, a PhD candidate in the <a href = "https://ph.ucla.edu/departments/epidemiology">Department of Epidemiology</a> at UCLA, advised by <a href = "https://ph.ucla.edu/about/faculty-staff-directory/onyebuchi-arah/">Dr. Onyebuchi Arah</a>. My dissertation work applies graphical tools to causal inference applications in cancer epidemiology and vaccine effectiveness research.

            Before joining UCLA Epidemiology, I worked as a research associate with the <a href = "https://www.ncdipoverty.org/lancet-commission">Lancet Commission on Reframing Noncommunicable Diseases (NCDs) and Injuries for the Poorest Billion</a> at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital. My work focused on describing associations between NCDs and poverty-related risks, estimating potential impact of implementing health system interventions to increase coverage of care for NCDs in countries with low levels of coverage, and incorporating metrics for equity into priority setting processes for NCD-related policy and implementation. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            I earned a Master's of Public Health in Global Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington during a fellowship at the <a href = "https://www.healthdata.org/">Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation</a> (IHME). During my time at IHME, I primarily worked on demographic estimates for the Global Burden of Disease Study, particularly all-cause mortality. As an undergraduate, I studied Neurobiology at Harvard University, with a minor in Global Health and Health Policy.

Welcome to my research page! I'm a PhD student in Biostatistics at the [University of Washington](http://biostat.washington.edu/).

Before joining UW Biostatistics, I studied Organismic and Evolutionary Biology at [Harvard University](http://oeb.harvard.edu/), with a language citation in Spanish. I was a research associate at the [Institute for Genomic Medicine](http://igm.columbia.edu) at Columbia University.

I currently work with [Dr. Noah Simon](https://faculty.washington.edu/nrsimon/) and [Dr. Marco Carone](http://faculty.washington.edu/mcarone/about.html), developing nonparametric estimation methods for variable importance in the context of survival analysis. My collaborative projects include work with [Dr. Bruce Weir](https://www.biostat.washington.edu/people/bruce-weir) and [Dr. Sam Wasser](https://www.biology.washington.edu/people/profile/samuel-k-wasser), adapting forensic genetic techniques to combat elephant poaching. My research is supported by an [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/).
