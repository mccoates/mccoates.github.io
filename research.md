## Research interests
I am broadly interested in epidemiological methods and causal inference in population health.
A few areas of interest are:
* The use of graphical tools in causal inference to understand bias
* Modeling potential population health impact of interventions and policies
* Health metrics to inform decision-making
* Non-"lifestyle" risk factors for non-communicable diseases
